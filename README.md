# ML-student-performance-predictor
## Project Overview
This project is a hands-on experiment aimed at comparing different machine learning models to predict student performance. We emphasize hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation of tree-based models.

### Objectives
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Learn how to tune hyperparameters for better model accuracy.
- **Model Comparison**: Train and evaluate models like Decision Trees and Random Forests to compare their performance.

### Dataset
- **Student Performance Dataset**: The dataset contains information about students' personal details, study time, family background, and performance scores. The CSV file (`student-por.csv`) can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).

### Key Steps
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Importing the dataset and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights about student performance, study habits, and demographic information.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train different tree-based models and evaluate their performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run the notebook from start to finish.

This project is a great learning exercise for understanding tree-based machine learning models and hyperparameter optimization.
